# Crypto-Haste
This is a fork of haste-server which supports client side encryption using sjcl and some minor tweaks such as forced highlight language specification. 

If you would like to see a running copy, see http://3d3.ca.
You may also be interested in [3d3client](https://github.com/k3d3/3d3client), capable of sending and viewing encrypted pastes from the command line.

See haste-README.md for setup details.
